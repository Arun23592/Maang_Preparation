/**
* FirstandLastOccurenceSortedArray.java
*
* Purpose:
* - Find the first and last occurrence of a target value in a sorted integer array.
* - Uses modified binary search twice: once to find first occurrence (left-biased),
* once to find last occurrence (right-biased).
*
* Time Complexity: O(log n)
* Space Complexity: O(1)
*
* Notes:
* - Binary search uses mid = left + (right - left) / 2 to avoid integer overflow.
* - If the target is not found, methods return -1.



"This code uses a modified binary search approach to find the first and last occurrence of a number in a sorted array. It performs binary search twice: one biased to the left to find the first occurrence, and one biased to the right to find the last occurrence. The complexity is O(log n) time and O(1) space, which is optimal for sorted arrays. A minor bug is in the calculation of mid in findLast(), which should use left + (right - left)/2 to avoid overflow and incorrect values."

âœ… Alternative Approach

Linear Search:

Scan array left to right for first occurrence.

Scan array right to left for last occurrence.

Time Complexity: O(n).

Simple but not optimal for large arrays.
